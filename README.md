This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK: errors arising from incorrectly formatted options objects passed during initialization or method calls. The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides the corrected version and explanations of best practices.  This issue can be particularly challenging to debug due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations, where errors may not surface immediately. Proper validation of options objects and clear error handling are crucial for robust Firebase applications.
