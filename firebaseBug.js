The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided options object is malformed or missing required properties during initialization or when calling specific methods.  For instance, setting an invalid database URL or omitting authentication details can lead to unexpected behavior and errors that may not be immediately apparent due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.
